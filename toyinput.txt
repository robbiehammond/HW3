This is a document. This document has text in it. This document is my "toy" file. It does not have that much text.
However, it has enough text to make the hash table increase in size at least once. Depending on how much more I type,
it might even increase twice. Here are some random symbols and numbers that aren't going to be put into the
table: @#)!^#*^$12312312. Words that contain apostrophes still get cut into two words, as the directions stated that
it is fine for that to happen. But, to see this work with a larger document, refer other output instead of this one.
